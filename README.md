### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/ericpastorm/CalculatorX.git](https://github.com/ericpastorm/CalculatorX.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd YourRepoName
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh

## üì¶ Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment to GitHub Pages.

1.  Make sure the `base` property in `vite.config.js` matches your repository name (e.g., `base: '/YourRepoName/'`).
2.  Run the deploy script:

## üîÆ Future Feature: Test Mode

The next major feature planned for Calculator++ is an interactive **"Test Mode"** designed to help users practice their math skills.

In this mode, the calculator will:
1.  Automatically generate simple arithmetic problems (e.g., `15 * 3 = ?`).
2.  Display the problem on the screen.
3.  Allow the user to input their answer using the calculator keys.
4.  Check if the user's answer is correct and provide immediate feedback.
5.  Keep track of a score or a streak of correct answers.

This will transform the calculator from a simple tool into an engaging educational app.
